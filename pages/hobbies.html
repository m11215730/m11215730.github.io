                    <p class="card-text">Anime is word for Japanese animation/cartoons, one the reason of calling it
                        "Anime" is because the word cartoons, is usually for children, which is "子供向" in Japanese.
                        Anime could include all type of topic like drama and movie, but in a more exaggerated
                        expression, which is a better way for creator to emphasize things. Gundam would be great example
                        for this. It has different series and most of the
                        series are my favourite. <br>My most favourite "Gundam 00", it is an anime showed sorrow or
                        tragedy
                        made by war, the cruelness of war and humanity, how people fight to reach their justice and
                        dream, and the good vision of mankind can understand each other and united together.

                        Nowadays, most of the people should have the experience of playing mobile games, or even have
                        handheld console like the Nintendo Switch. However, those who truly understand the charm of
                        video game is not much. A movies can let you have a 2 hours vision and audio experience, but
                        video games allow you to "live" in the world for a couple hundred hours. A well made 3A video
                        game is definitely cannot compare to mobile games, the expressiveness is not in the same
                        dimension. And for movie, movie might have better expression, but Immersive experience is
                        something that only video games can do.
                        <br>
                        One of my favourite video game would be "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt", I would say it's a legend in
                        video games, and not outdated even compare to the 3A games today. The game is based on the
                        Polish writer, Andrzej Sapkowski's masterpiece "The Witcher". The game is set in the Continent,
                        a fantasy world surrounded by parallel dimensions and extra-dimensional worlds and it's talk
                        about how Geralt found his adopted daughter Ciri and how he help her to face her fate of being
                        the chosen one.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Head-Fi, is "mobile Hi-fi", mostly mean Headphone, In-ear monitor(IEM) and Digital Audio
                        Player(DAP).It's less expensive than Hi-Fi speaker, but doesn't mean it's cheap. So how I got
                        trapped in to it lol? it's because anime and video game provide many high quality song and bgm
                        and long time ago my friend gave me an Amazon coupon, and I bought my first expensive earphones.
                        Then the things go unstoppable XD. It's like once you won a 4K HDR TV, you can't go backward.
                        Recently I bought a second-hand DAP, Astell&Kern SR15, and I found my IEM RHA T20 cannot
                        satisfied me anymore, it has a pretty good bass, and it doesn't cover the mid and tremble in
                        most of the time, but last time I hanging out with my friend and I found something better.
                        "音響窮三代 攝影累全家" is exactly describing my situation.

            <p>I think most people have the similar experience in secondary school, so I'm gonna start from after
                graduate
                in secondary school</p>
            <h3>After graduated secondary school, where did I go?</h3>
            <p>
                After graduation, I received an offer from IVE, Software Engineering in Higher Diploma. I accepted this
                offer because I study ICT before, so I think I can get use to it. However, things I learned from IVE is
                way complicated than secondary schools, and it also make me think secondary school didn't teach enough
                about programming. In secondary school we just learn about Javascript, from int to array, if and loop,
                we don't even learn about function, which make us hard to adapt higher education. Fortunately, I got
                three friends in IVE which help me a lot. Also IVE's teacher is enthusiastic on teaching and friendly,
                especially Mr Alan Po and Mr Peter Ma, both of them gave me a big hand in class and also FYP project.
            </p>
            <h3>University life</h3>
            <p>After I finished the HD programme, I got the offer of Financial Technology degree, and I really
                appreciated it. I'm still adjusting my study pattern because it's different from IVE and as an IT
                student, it's hard to manage the finance knowledge. I was look forward to university life, but due to
                the situation happening, the whole society is covered in sorrow and darkness, I hope things will get
                better after this year.</p>
